    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>If you've got to eat your broccoli, this is a great way to do it. A beautiful side dish of broccoli and angel
        hair pasta with red pepper flakes is so delicious and so aromatic.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds broccoli</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus a little more for garnish </li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes for garnish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Hold a sharp knife at a 45-degree angle and cut the florets from the broccoli stems into a bowl. Chop
            remaining stems into small pieces and transfer stems to a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil with butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook garlic in the hot oil-butter
            mixture, stirring often, until garlic is soft but not browned. Sprinkle in 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes and
            salt. Pour chicken stock into skillet and bring to a simmer. Stir broccoli stems into the stock mixture and
            simmer until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Add a little water or stock if mixture starts to dry out.</li>
        <li>Stir broccoli florets into skillet and cook broccoli sauce until florets are bright green and slightly
            tender, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and stir in angel hair pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
            pasta strands are almost tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large pot.</li>
        <li>Pour broccoli sauce over pasta, stir with a wooden spoon, and mix in 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            Cover pot with a lid and let stand until pasta absorbs excess liquid and finishes cooking, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve in bowls and sprinkle each serving with a dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and a pinch of red
            pepper flakes.</li>
    </ol>
